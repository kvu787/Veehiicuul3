## Style

For single and double quotes, only use the ASCII forms: ', "
Never use these: “, ”, ‘, ’, etc.

## Development platform compatibility

Support Windows 11 x64 as the only development platform.

## External tools

You may use the tools in `%UserProfile%\Program`.
You may refer to local copies of source repos in `%UserProfile%\Repository\External`.

# PowerShell

Use modern PowerShell whose command should be `pwsh`, not legacy PowerShell.

## Git

When implementing stuff, avoid difficult-to-review "mega-commits".
When it makes sense, split work into multiple commits to make it easier to review.
Separate commits that record conversations from other commits.

## Markdown tables

Tables in Markdown must be padded and aligned in a way to make them easy to read in a plaintext editor, not only in a Markdown viewer.

## Mathematical notation in Markdown

Any mathematical notation in Markdown files (LaTeX, KaTeX, MathJax, etc) must display properly in VSCode's Markdown previewer, GitHub.com's Markdown displayer, and the markdown viewer in the Windows 11 ChatGPT app.

## PowerShell

All PowerShell scripts must use:

- Set-StrictMode -Version Latest
- $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'

## Conversations

Record verbatim and commit all conversations in a folder named `Conversations` located at the root of this Git repo.
Use one file per conversation.
Prefix these files with the PowerShell evaluation of `[DateTime]::UtcNow.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm") + "_UTC"`.
Prefix these commits with `[cnv]`.
If I attach images to prompts, save and record these in the conversation logs.
If the conversation begins with `dnr`, then do not record the conversation.

## Application compatibility

Do not attempt to maintain any sort of application compatibility between different commits of the repo. This creates unwanted complexity.

## Target platform compatibility

Support Windows 11 x64 as the only target platform.
